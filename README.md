# OpenPTC
Open Source Protothrottle Compatible Controller

This is a simple, Protothrottle Compatible Transmitter that I have been working on.  It should work with any of the default base stations etc 
but I have only tested it with my own deadrail receiver.  For now, it is a work in progress, I am planning on a simple python/windows app to program 
the function codes for each button and switch, but for now it's somewhat hardcoded.
